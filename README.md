Application of ML methods to classify (recognition) of digit numbers from images
#####NOTE##### If you have issues loading the notebook on github (as github have some backend malefunctions loading large Jupyter notebook files) you can check the codes from nbviewer :
SVHN dataset: https://nbviewer.org/github/A-Arhami/Digit-number-recognistions/blob/main/1_MLP_CNN_SVHNdataset.ipynb
MNIST dataset: https://nbviewer.org/github/A-Arhami/Digit-number-recognistions/blob/main/CNN_MNIST.ipynb
